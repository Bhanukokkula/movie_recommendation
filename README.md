Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes user-item interactions to recommend movies based on the preferences of similar users.
  
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies by analyzing the content of the movies and comparing it with user preferences.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Data
- **MovieLens Dataset:** The dataset used for this project contains user ratings, movie details, and other relevant information. You can download the dataset [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
 - Load and preprocess the MovieLens dataset.
 - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Collaborative Filtering:**
 - Run the collaborative filtering script (`collaborative_filtering.py`) to train the collaborative filtering model.
 - Use the model to generate movie recommendations for users.

3. **Content-Based Filtering:**
 - Run the content-based filtering script (`content_based_filtering.py`) to train the content-based filtering model.
 - Generate movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie content.

4. **Hybrid Model (Optional):**
 - Combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for a hybrid recommendation approach.

## Files
- **data/:** Folder containing the MovieLens dataset.
- **collaborative_filtering.py:** Script for collaborative filtering recommendation.
- **content_based_filtering.py:** Script for content-based filtering recommendation.
- **hybrid_model.py (optional):** Script for combining collaborative and content-based filtering.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project.

## Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision, recall, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Results
- Present the results of the recommendation system, including any insights gained and user satisfaction metrics.

## Future Work
- Discuss potential improvements or enhancements that can be made to the recommendation system.
- Consider incorporating deep learning techniques or exploring other recommendation algorithms.
